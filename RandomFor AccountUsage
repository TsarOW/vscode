hello, this is a trash text.
Then why did you create this, you  may ask. 
Well, Very good question, I created this because this is my backup github for all the risky/gabage decision makings.
And I need to use my account to some extent, so that this junk account can be better than all other junk account.
See, I told you, this is a junk text. Only a gabege person like you may "accidentally" read this text. I'm saying  you, the all mighty github accouning guy.
:)
